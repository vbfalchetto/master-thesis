# master-thesis: **Trajectory tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle with filtered states**

This repo contains some of the files related to my master's research.

If you are interested in reading the full text, then I offer you with three options:
- Light version: [compressed version here](Falchetto_ViniciusBomfim_M_compressed.pdf)
- DOI (uni link): [https://doi.org/10.47749/T/UNICAMP.2016.972559](https://doi.org/10.47749/T/UNICAMP.2016.972559 )

The goal is also to make available the folowing files:
- [ ] matlab simulation codes;
- [ ] published papers and drafts;


## System Modeling and implementation: Euler Angles AND Quaternions.

1. Include both simulations in different folders.
2. Include toy examples showing the mumerical differences between quaternions and Euler angles implementations.
3. Include python codes for the abovementioned models and simulations.


## Adding some unrelated codes of the thesis
