# master-thesis: **Trajectory tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle with filtered states**

This repo contains some of the files related to my master's research.

The idea is to make available the folowing files:
- [x] thesis's pdf: [compressed version here](Falchetto_ViniciusBomfim_M_compressed.pdf)
- [ ] matlab simulation codes;
- [ ] published papers and drafts;

For starters, you may find the full text available at:
- DOI (uni link): [https://doi.org/10.47749/T/UNICAMP.2016.972559](https://doi.org/10.47749/T/UNICAMP.2016.972559 )

## System Modeling and implementation: Euler Angles AND Quaternions.

1. Include both simulations in different folders.
2. Include toy examples showing the mumerical differences between quaternions and Euler angles implementations.
3. Include python codes for the abovementioned models and simulations.
